"Harry Potter","Sophomore","false","N/A","Java","Postgres","Full-Stack","true","false","2025-11-22 - He has strong problem-solving skills and is especially good at reasoning about data structures and complexity. His code tends to be efficient and clean, and he frequently goes beyond the assignment requirements by adding extra validation and logging to test edge cases.|2025-11-22 - Although he is quiet in class, Harry participates actively in office hours and always comes prepared with specific questions. He is reliable, meets deadlines, and is honest when he is stuck, which makes him easy to mentor and a solid recommendation candidate."
"Sarah Ryan","Senior","false","N/A","C++","MongoDB","Back-End","true","false","2025-11-22 - Sarah consistently turns in assignments early and asks thoughtful follow-up questions about design trade-offs, not just syntax. Her project code is well-documented, and she often helps classmates debug layout or state-management issues without being condescending or impatient.|2025-11-22 - During our group project, Sarah naturally took the lead in organizing tasks and making sure everyone contributed. She writes clear Git commit messages, keeps the repository clean, and proactively communicates blockers, which makes her an excellent candidate for internships or letters of recommendation."
"Kim Possible","Senior","true","Intuit","Python","MongoDB","Full-Stack","true","false","2025-11-22 - Kim has a strong grasp of both theory and implementation. She designs clear experiments, documents her assumptions, and uses version control responsibly. Her reports are well-written, and she often draws insightful connections between coursework and real-world data science problems.|2025-11-22 - In team settings, Kim is supportive and professional. She balances taking initiative with listening to others, and she is very dependable with deadlines. I would comfortably recommend her for research roles, internships, or graduate-level opportunities in data-focused positions."
"Jason Lee","Graduate","true","Intern at Nokia","Java","MongoDB","Front-End","false","true","2025-11-22 - Jason frequently submits assignments late or not at all, even after multiple reminders and deadline extensions. When work is submitted, it is often incomplete and lacks basic testing or documentation, suggesting that he is not currently prioritizing his coursework or responsibilities.|2025-11-22 - During group work, several teammates reported difficulty reaching Jason and getting him to participate. He has potential but needs to demonstrate consistent effort, follow-through, and professional communication before I would feel comfortable recommending him for future opportunities."
"Emily Vox","Junior","false","N/A","Python","MongoDB","Back-End","false","true","2025-11-22 - Emily has struggled with basic course expectations, including submitting original work. On one occasion, there were strong similarities between her code and another student’s solution, and after discussion she did not provide a clear explanation of her process or sources.|2025-11-22 - While she is polite in person, her academic reliability is low. She missed multiple quizzes without communication and did not follow up to make a realistic plan for improvement. For now, I would not recommend her for roles requiring strong accountability or independence."
"Michael Jackson","Senior","true","Intern at Adobe","C++|Java","MySQL","Back-End","false","true","2025-11-22 - Michael often arrives late to class and leaves early, which makes it difficult for him to follow lectures or participate meaningfully. Several assignments were submitted with minimal effort, missing core requirements and lacking comments or any sign of testing.|2025-11-22 - When discussing recommendations or future opportunities, I would need to see substantial improvement in consistency, communication, and responsibility. Right now, I cannot confidently vouch for his reliability in a professional or academic setting beyond this course."
